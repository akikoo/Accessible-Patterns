# Accessible Patterns

## What is it?

A collection of frequently used rich interface patterns. The idea is to build and 
maintain a library of accessible ARIA widgets, without any skin. There are hundreds 
of plugins like these out there, but many of them don't have keyboard accessibility, 
for example. So I started creating my own versions of common interface patterns, 
taking ideas and code from other plugins (see credits in each plugin).

People want to see pretty things. But what if you don't see it, is it still usable?
Focus is on scripting here, not styling. Styling is kept to a bare minimum, often 
only the classes are listed. I believe it's faster to start from scratch than first 
clean up the plugin styles, or overwrite them, as is the case with many plugins. 
Your project requires a custom skin anyway, so I don't want to waste your time 
with demo styling. Accessible user interfaces go deeper than that.
